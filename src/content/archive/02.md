## How to get CS50 certificates for free?

<div class="text-xl">
The CS50 course itself is free, but obtaining a certificate depends on the platform you use:

1. <span class="text-jefferson-main">edX</span>: You can take the CS50 course for free, but you need to pay for a verified certificate.
2. <span class="text-jefferson-main">CS50's Official Website (cs50.harvard.edu)</span>: Certificates are available for free directly through Harvard’s CS50 website.
</div>

## Other than that you can also follow this roadmap:

<div class="text-xl">

<span class="underline underline-offset-2 decoration-wavy"> [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/)</span>, developed by <span class="underline underline-offset-2 decoration-wavy"> [Kamran Ahmed](https://github.com/kamranahmedse)</span>, provides thorough learning pathways with carefully chosen resources and skill-development milestones to help individuals—such as self-taught learners—as they navigate a variety of technology fields.
